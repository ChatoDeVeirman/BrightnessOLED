# Adapt Brightness
Map `dec_brightness` and `inc_brightness` to any 2 keys and you will be able to adapt the brightness of your screen.
## Startup
The scripts will save a file named `brightness` in `~/scripts/`; Whenever you add `dimmer-startup.sh` as a startup script, it will automatically restore your last brightness.
